# What do scientists use computers for all day?

- got our data on there
- analyze it there too
- use it to do our experiments
- read (& discover) other people's stuff sometimes
- write & communicate

so a lot of stuff! computers must be our friends or something

one might expect us to have

~~ diigital infrasssttructure ~~

Notes: (comic-book texture diagram of these different uses of a computer, or like a where's waldo tableau?)

# So what kinda stuff do we have for that then?

this much shorter, much blippier than a full explanation.
want to get 'computers are impt, actually we're missing some stuff,
it's more serious than just not caring, introducing the components
in like <4-5m

* data
  - some standards are emerging, but mostly everyone does their own thing!!!
  - some public stores of data, some of them even used!!!
  - largely non-interoperable, we're lucky if we have data standardized, but standards don't talk to one another
* tools
  - in the recent past, tons of dope, underfunded, open-source tools
  - analysis libraries enabling the future, but reproducibility is still sorta hard!
  - still very hard! have to basically write a library to do an experiment!
* communication
  - pdfs and ppts baby!
  - conferences
  - godforsaken science twitter
  - private slacks...

---

# Not Just Inconvenience...

* Labor Devaluation
  - Prodigious Redundancy
  - Little means of Credit Assignment
  - Data Loss is Labor Loss
* Resource Concentration
  - Expertise and Resources Siloed in few Institutions
  - Public resources made private academic capital
* Disproportionate Effects on ECRs
  - No Infrastructure is the defining reality
  - Everyday Redevelopment *and* "Open Science" falls to ECRs
  - "Everyone Has to be a Programmer Now"
* Scientific Health
  - Replication crisis inevitable
  - Subdisciplinary Silos
  - Stunted scientific discourse
  - Solaris-like futility

      Much technological infrastructure development
      has been motivated by the belief that if we build it they will come. ...<br/><br/>
      <strong>It is not enough to put out a new
      technical infrastructure – it needs to be woven into the daily
        practices of knowledge workers.</strong> <br/><br/> We are dealing with a massively
      entrenched set of institutions, built around the last information age and
      fighting for its life.

say that we'll get to alternatives as we go

but it's not just about them individually,
it's about the way they interact dog, just wait.

## Listen to the people who do this for a living...

* Librarians & Information Scientists
* STS researchers and technological ethicists
* Pirates & Hackers

Notes: Maybe spatially, as a map with a dotted line curving through it?
where are we now & why
three interlocking systems & how to get to them.
