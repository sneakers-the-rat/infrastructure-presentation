# Not Just Inconvenience...

* Labor Devaluation
  - Prodigious Redundancy
  - Little means of Credit Assignment
  - Data Loss is Labor Loss
* Resource Concentration
  - Expertise and Resources Siloed in few Institutions
  - Public resources made private academic capital
* Disproportionate Effects on ECRs
  - No Infrastructure is the defining reality
  - Everyday Redevelopment *and* "Open Science" falls to ECRs
  - "Everyone Has to be a Programmer Now"
* Scientific Health
  - Replication crisis inevitable
  - Subdisciplinary Silos
  - Stunted scientific discourse
  - Solaris-like futility

      Much technological infrastructure development

but it's not just about them individually,
it's about the way they interact dog, just wait.

## Listen to the people who do this for a living...

* Librarians & Information Scientists
* STS researchers and technological ethicists
* Pirates & Hackers

Notes: Maybe spatially, as a map with a dotted line curving through it?
where are we now & why
three interlocking systems & how to get to them.
