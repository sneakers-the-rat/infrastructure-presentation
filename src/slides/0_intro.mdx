# What do scientists use computers for all day?

- got our data on there
- analyze it there too
- use it to do our experiments
- read (& discover) other people's stuff sometimes
- write & communicate

so a lot of stuff! computers must be our friends or something

one might expect us to have

~~ diigital infrasssttructure ~~

Notes: (comic-book texture diagram of these different uses of a computer, or like a where's waldo tableau?)

# So what kinda stuff do we have for that then?

this much shorter, much blippier than a full explanation.
want to get 'computers are impt, actually we're missing some stuff,
it's more serious than just not caring, introducing the components
in like <4-5m

* data
  - some standards are emerging, but mostly everyone does their own thing!!!
  - some public stores of data, some of them even used!!!
  - largely non-interoperable, we're lucky if we have data standardized, but standards don't talk to one another
* tools
  - in the recent past, tons of dope, underfunded, open-source tools
  - analysis libraries enabling the future, but reproducibility is still sorta hard!
  - still very hard! have to basically write a library to do an experiment!
* communication
  - pdfs and ppts baby!
  - conferences
  - godforsaken science twitter
  - private slacks...

---

# Not just a nerd problem thing though

* labor devaluing
  - prodigious waste of labor!
  - little means for credit assignment outside of published papers
  - much data and labor is lost or wasted either completely hard-drived or not taken advantage of
* effects on ecrs
  - most extra labor pushed onto ecrs -- open science is mostly assigning extra work to extremely poorly paid workers.
  - everyone has to be a programmer now to make up for ther undone labor of infrastructure
  - catastrophic data loss being a part of being a scientist is *traumatic* and *unnecessary*
* resource concentration
  - resources are concentrated at relatively few institutes & labs
  - some have access to eperts & core facilities & well stocked labs but many dont
  - so much *contextual* knowledge is lost because there isn't a means of preserving it,
    which is disproportionately worse for non-elite labs.
* scientific health
  - it's hard to publish data so it's rare
  - it's hard to replicate analyses so it's rare
  - it's hard to reproduce experiments so it's rare
  - it's hard to express scientific ideas outside your subdiscipline so it's rare
  - it might actually be impossible to understand the brain by looking at only the datasets
    we collect in our lab/small groups of lab/the allen institute
  - the only thing we have is papers and science twitter which is slow or toxic

# "Let us now anathemize techno hubris"

v briefly, just making the points that there are lots of ways this could shake out,
say that we'll get to alternatives as we go

open science is fraught af rn. many are starting to get turned off of the entire
endeavor of 'scientific reform' or 'making things slightly less bad'

platformatization model is rampant where little slices of the problem are divided among
for-profit companies

increasing reliance on eg. amazon for data storage,
becoming complicit in an extractive monopoly

This isn't as simple as "need more funding" or
"need more development time." We need to restructure
our approach to developing infrastructure in a way
that a) holistically solves the problem and
b) is not ignorant of, but driven by the ethical
implications of the plan

If you build it they won't necessarily come!

> Let us now anathematize techno hubris.
Much technological infrastructure development
has been motivated by the belief that if we build it they will come.
Little was learned from the experience of supercomputer centers
(built, they didn’t come) or collaboratories
(built, they left early). It is not enough to put out a new
technical infrastructure – it needs to be woven into the daily
practices of knowledge workers. ... **We are dealing with a massively
entrenched set of institutioned, built around the last information age and fighting for its life.**
- https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-9789-8_5

---

> While different platforms aim to apply the concepts of
social media to some restricted subset of the research process \[...] it does not take much
imagination to anticipate that once the market shakes itself out,
and one platform eventually comes to dominate its competitors
within key segments of certain sciences, Google or some similar
corporate entity or some state-supported public/private partnership
will come along with its deep pockets, and
integrate each segment into one grand proprietary Science 2.0
platform. Who would not then want to own the obligatory online
passage point for the bulk of modern scientific research?

Not utopian, not cataclysmic, but a practical plan for how to learn from decades
of knowledge from decentralized knowledge communities, pirates, hackers,
information scientists, librarians, and so on.

Notes: like a heaven and hell diptich or something being like i'm not selling u a bunch
of bull honkey here i'm also considering the practical path forwrad.

# Decentralized infrastructure

(title slide introducing the three broad areas)

Maybe spatially, as a map with a dotted line curving through it?
where are we now & why
three interlocking systems & how to get to them.

      {
        title: 'Shared Data',
        body: 'A federated peer-to-peer data sharing system',

but it's not just about them individually,
it's about the way they interact dog, just wait.
drop the map elements and highlight combinatoric effects

# Why is it like this

But first... the field of infra proposals is littered with the corpses of previous attempts
So what is it exactly that we propose to do differently?

* diversity of measurements & preps
* hacker spirit and celebration of heroism (heterogeneity is good, the 'hero' part not so good!)
* focus on the science
* combinatorics of recent technology
* dispersion of structures & incentives

---

# Structural & Incentive Dispersion

## Who's working on what?

vertical stack with arrow pointing to effect on infrastructure

* shits truly different with core facilities, and they can displace the development of infrastructure
* consortia are great, but they dont' intrinsically produce infrastructure c.f. ibl
* institutions are also great but they also don't necessarily produce infrastructure and can be big boondoggles like bluebrain
* BRAIN grant is working on this but it's unfocused and without a development plan to speak of, instead a private grant dissemination process like usual
* Open source world!

like these are all centralized answers or uncoordinated answers
