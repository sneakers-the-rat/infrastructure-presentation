# Shared Knowledge

<Quote>
  "Providing tools and infrastructure mechanisms that support
  the development and management of policies*
  <TextAnimator>[and knowledge and schemas and everything else]</TextAnimator>
  is an important part of creating social computing systems
  that work."
  - "dont look now weve created a bureaucracy"</Quote>




Notes: shared knowledge notes

* Reintroduce notion of labor inequity and lack of credit assignment
* failure of contextual knowledge
* distortion of scientific communication mediums
* a means of assigning credit to labor and
* the resistance of scientific infrastructure from platformatizing

Return of pirate communities and learning from wikis
Semantic wiki infrastructure as the third photoreceptor that
multiplies the power of the previous two pillars.


# Thinking expansively

* A common lack in all these tools is that they don't really have a clear means for
people to communicate about their use, to interact with the shared components.
* Relatedly, our embrace of heterogeneity and federation has also left us with
a bunch of disordered schemas, what to do?

Here's three steps on a gradient for software
* Traditional software library -- code is fixed, but you can create local files. like MS paint
* Extensible software library -- certain features can be added in
* Modular software library -- the basic components of the system can be swapped out
* ??? -- natural final step is some way of discussing and governing the module combinations

And in schemas
* Traditional centralized schama -- there is one vocabulary
* Extensible schema -- there is a core vocabulary and a way of making new terms
* Modular schema -- core links can be replaced by links with comparable semantic structure
* ??? -- a way of negotiating the links between data and meaning of terms


My argument: investment in collaborative design and communication tools is the missing link

# The Semantic Web

> The Semantic Web is an attempt, largely, to map large quantities of
existing data onto a common language so that the data can be analyzed
in ways never dreamed of by its creators. If, for example, a web page
with weather data has RDF describing that data, a user can retrieve it
as a table, perhaps average it, plot it, deduce things from it in
combination with other information. At the other end of the scale is
the weather information portrayed by the cunning Java applet.
While this might allow a very cool user interface, it cannot be
analyzed at all. The search engine finding the page will have no
idea of what the data is or what it is about. The only way to find
out what a Java applet means is to set it running in front of a person.

# Schema negotiation
and data linking and tool linking all on the same slide
NWB schema, link to another schema, then link to tools, then link to analysis...

# Semantic wikis

* https://wiki.auto-pi-lot.com/index.php/Autopilot_Wiki
* https://open-behavior.auto-pi-lot.com/index.php/Main_Page
* https://iblwiki.auto-pi-lot.com/

Notes: whats missing


# whats missing from wikis

* voting
* discussions
* modern javascript tools and interactive components
* typesetting tools and flexible syntax
* lots of UI loveliness is hard to reach like workign with files, visual editor, etc.
