# Comparison

comparison of server architecture and p2p quantitatively.

Notes: popup with more info

That p2p system is literally the most basic one. extend it in a bunch of ways

* Versioning
* Obligate Peers - making it always at least as fast as

---

# problems with p2p systems

* ppl freaking drop out!
* rare material can get lost if only one peer has it!
* make networks sad! (this one is just a QoS one so we can ignore that)

but what if i told u that there have been hundreds of thousands of people experimenting
with the culture of how to make a peer-to-peer data archival system
sustainable for decades? and those ppl are pirates?

We get one early lesson from the pirates, and thats to divide the
*database* itself from the *means of accessing it*

# Interdependent Frontends Are Cool, But...

We're familiar with extremely sick, domain-specific databases like this one from the IBL:

# Databases Are Political

If we pay attention to the people who study these things...

      <Quote fontSize={36}>
        Participants describe the individual sequence database
        systems as if they were shadows, poor representations of a
        widely-agreed-upon ideal. [...] Instead, <strong>each decision about the implementation of a particular
        database system plants a stake for a community boundary.</strong>
        The databases are not so much imperfect copies of an ideal as
        they are arguments about what the ideal Database should be.
        <br/><br/>
        In the end, however, the system was so tailored to a specific
        set of research questions that the collection of data,
        the set of tools, and even the social organization of the
        project had to be significantly changed. ...
        <br/><br/>While the database development projects had begun by working
        together, in the end they were unable to collaborate. <strong>The system
        that was supposed to tie these groups together could not be
        shielded from the controversies that formed the boundaries between
        the communities of practice.</strong>
