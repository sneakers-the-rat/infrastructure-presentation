# p2p

Once we have our data standardized, now what?
Say this dot is u, and u are going to share some data
Wat do u do

(start by fading in peer, then bring in server, then add in other
ppl who want to download)

# p2p vs servers

comparison of server architecture and p2p quantitatively.

Notes: popup with more info

That p2p system is literally the most basic one. extend it in a bunch of ways

* Versioning
* Obligate Peers - making it always at least as fast as

---

# problems with p2p systems

* ppl freaking drop out!
* rare material can get lost if only one peer has it!
* make networks sad! (this one is just a QoS one so we can ignore that)

but what if i told u that there have been hundreds of thousands of people experimenting
with the culture of how to make a peer-to-peer data archival system
sustainable for decades? and those ppl are pirates?

here's a hint the answer is that *archives need communities* and
we will return to that later

---

# ok now how we get the data?

another thing we typically do is link a 'database' with its frontend.

eg. this extremely sick thing from the IBL:

<Box width={"80%"} height={"80%"} margin={"auto"}>
<Paper elevation={1} style={{width:"100%", height:"100%"}}>
<iframe width={"100%"} height={"100%"}

# databases are not neutral

> Participants describe the individual sequence database
systems as if they were shadows, poor representations of a
widely-agreed-upon ideal. We find, however, that by looking
across the landscape of databases, a different picture emerges.
Instead, each decision about the implementation of a particular
database system plants a stake for a community boundary.
The databases are not so much imperfect copies of an ideal as
they are arguments about what the ideal Database should be.
...
In the end, however, the system was so tailored to a specific
set of research questions that the collection of data,
the set of tools, and even the social organization of the
project had to be significantly changed. New analysis tools
were developed and old tools were discarded. Not only was the
database ported to a different technology, the data itself was
significantly restructured to fit the new tools and approaches.
While the database development projects had begun by working
together, in the end they were unable to collaborate. The system
that was supposed to tie these groups together could not be
shielded from the controversies that formed the boundaries between
the communities of practice.

# Lessons from piracy...

<Grid gridTemplateColumns={"2fr 1fr"} height={"100%"}>
<Box width={2/3}>
interesting side effect of the separation of torrent clients
(things that download the stuff)
and trackers

bittorrent works by exchanging small .torrent files or magnet links with cryptographic
hashes but you need some way of finding them!

so there are these trackers, u might be familiar with this 1
</Box>
<Image src={PirateBay} maxWidth={"100%"} alignSelf={"center"} />
</Grid>

## Private Trackers:
## a massive decadeslong experiment in decentralized archives

torrent trackers operate like archives, and need some way of
regulating the quality of uploads and managing the incentives
to prevent free riders

interview in or invite-only, each tracker has its own culture, rules,
history, and specific tools that facilitate it.

huge untapped knowledge community that has been experimenting with
how to manage decentralized archival projects for decades


---

# Eg. What.cd, briefly




The lesson here is that we should implement a p2p system that
people can build interfaces on top of to suit their subdisciplinary
needs.

Problem though: they were still all separated -- you can't browse
another tracker's torrents. We need to have some way of preserving
the potential for compelteness of a centralized database
with the flexibility of separate UIs...

image from https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/5883

basic idea here is that we
a) conceptualize our data storage system as a *sharing* system first
b) choose who we share with and are *federated* with
c) allow different frontends to access our data in different ways and design tools around what they need
