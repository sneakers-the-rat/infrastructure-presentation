Notes: whatnow
* infrastructure for the "rest of us"
* yes conversion, and datajoint elements makes it even cooler
* local semantic wiki to seed with basic knowledge
  * collab w/ open behavior ppl & ibl & i hear there's a new rat group starting
* start using existing tools and getting to know the ppl that are making them
  - eg. all in on getting shared server infra with datajoint a la brain initiative
  - then we can start suggesting/steering them <3
* we can do the experimental framework here w/ autopilot -- datajoint ppl say 'there is no behavioral software'

It would be easy to make some sweeping recommendations about what should be done, especially by governments. But to be compatible with the goal of a participatory communication system, the methods should be participatory too. The following ideas are meant to encourage discussion.
