# So whats up with ONICE...

* infrastructure for the "rest of us"
* yes conversion, and datajoint elements makes it even cooler
* local semantic wiki to seed with basic knowledge
  * collab w/ open behavior ppl & ibl & i hear there's a new rat group starting
* start using existing tools and getting to know the ppl that are making them
  - eg. all in on getting shared server infra with datajoint a la brain initiative
  - then we can start suggesting/steering them <3
* we can do the experimental framework here w/ autopilot -- datajoint ppl say 'there is no behavioral software'
