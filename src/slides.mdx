# The state of things...

Three collapsible material columns?

# Infrastructure is the alternative

We don't have to accept this as the "normal" state of affairs...

# Three Interlocking Systems

Give us three colors for each of them.

# Why is it like this

But first... the field of infra proposals is littered with the corpses of previous attempts
So what is it exactly that we propose to do differently?

The first thing is *consider the reasons for the problem* -- weirdly
almost always overlooked

Then *consider the ethics of the possible solutions*

Then *articulate the design philosophy of the proposed solution*

Then *articulate the solution itself*
